This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error and its solution. The `bug.ts` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs due to a type mismatch between the function's expected parameter and the provided argument.  The solution involves modifying the function or the way the argument is passed to match the expected type.
